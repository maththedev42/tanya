# Token Economy

Tanya reduces input tokens without hiding important state from the model,
verifier, or audit trail. The goal is the same outcome with fewer tokens,
especially on cheaper providers with smaller or stricter context windows.

## Layers

1. **Lite system prompt** trims prompt sections that are not needed for the
   current turn. It is opt-in until model routing ships:

   ```bash
   TANYA_LITE_PROMPT=1 tanya run "Inspect this bug"
   ```

   The legacy `TANYA_LITE_PROMPT` name is still accepted. Lite mode keeps
   workspace and stack facts, then drops unmatched skill packs, stale
   failure-mode packs, unused artifact indexes, and older history.

2. **System-prompt budget** runs automatically. Tanya caps system-prompt tokens
   to `contextWindow * 0.25` by default, using the active provider adapter's
   context window. Configure the ratio with:

   ```bash
   TANYA_PROMPT_BUDGET_RATIO=0.20 tanya run "Work in a small-window model"
   ```

   Drop priority is deterministic: failure-mode packs, artifact index, domain
   packs, language packs, framework packs. Workspace and stack facts are never
   dropped. A `prompt_budget_exceeded` event records what was removed.

3. **Tool-result truncation** keeps large outputs from dominating the next
   prompt. Tool results over 2 KB are shown as the first 1 KB, the last 500
   bytes, and a visible marker:

   ```text
   <truncated 49231 chars; ask for more (tool_call_id=call_123; you have 3 expand_result calls left this turn)>
   ```

   The full output is cached under
   `.tanya/cache/results/<runId>/<toolCallId>.txt`. The model can recover it
   with:

   ```json
   {"tool_call_id":"call_123"}
   ```

   or a byte range:

   ```json
   {"tool_call_id":"call_123","range":{"startByte":12000,"endByte":16000}}
   ```

4. **File-read deduplication** tracks reads by `path + size + mtime` inside a
   run. Re-reading an unchanged file returns:

   ```text
   [file unchanged since turn N, see tool_call <id> for content]
   ```

   `read_file { "path": "...", "force": true }` bypasses the marker and resets
   the dedup entry. Dedup state is cleared when compaction fires, because the
   original content may have left live history.

5. **Budget reporting** uses persisted run logs to show where tokens and cost
   went:

   ```text
   /budget
   /budget --json
   /budget --enforce --max-usd 0.50
   ```

   `--enforce` writes a session-scoped spend rule to `.tanya/permissions.json`
   through the M3 permission engine.

## Provider Prefix Caching (M15)

Providers with prefix caches (DeepSeek bills cache hits at roughly 1/50th to
1/120th of the fresh input rate) only hit on byte-identical request prefixes.
Tanya is built to keep that prefix stable:

- **Session-pinned system prompt.** Interactive sessions (`tanya serve`, the
  mac app) build the system prompt once, on the first turn, and reuse it
  verbatim for every later turn. Per-prompt adaptation (artifact-index hints,
  repo-map ranking, DoD block) is deliberately excluded from it — a system
  prompt that shifted with each user prompt re-billed the entire conversation
  at the miss rate every turn. One-shot `tanya run` invocations keep the
  adaptive per-run prompt, since they have no cross-turn cache to protect.
- **Append-only turn history.** Within a run, tool results are truncated once
  when pushed, never re-rendered, so earlier bytes do not change between
  model calls. Compaction and micro-snips rewrite history only under context
  pressure; when they fire, the cache miss is the price of staying inside the
  window.
- **Measured, not assumed.** Every run manifest persists `cachedPromptTokens`
  from the provider's usage report. `/cost` shows per-run cache percentages,
  the session hit-rate, and the estimated saving versus an all-miss run; eval
  reports include a suite-wide `Cache hit-rate` line.

## Tool Definition Knobs

Tools can tune truncation behavior in their `ToolDefinition`:

- `truncateLargeResults: false` disables catch-all truncation. `read_file`
  uses this because it already has windowed reads.
- `keepFullForVerifier: true` keeps verifier-facing output lossless while the
  model receives the truncated view. This is used for shell/write tools whose
  full output may contain verification evidence.

## Verification

M5.5 captured a pre-change golden baseline and reran it after token-economy
features shipped. Result: 27/27 golden profiles passed with 0 verifier-verdict
drift.

The synthetic 10-task token-economy bench measured 341,670 full input tokens
versus 76,990 optimized input tokens, a 77.5% reduction with 0% verifier
regression.
